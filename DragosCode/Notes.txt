There is no missing data and all features have a balanced distribution,
except for cholesterol (twice as many "normal" as "high"), diabetes (four times as many "No" as "Yes"),
Alzheimer's diagnosis (~42000 "No" to ~32000 "Yes"), Family history of Alzheimer's (twice as many "No" as "Yes"),
Genetic Risk Factor (four times as many "No" as "Yes") and hypertension (twice as many "No" as "Yes")
